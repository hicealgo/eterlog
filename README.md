# Eterlog

A simple, "eternal" logbook and note-taking app for personal use—perfect for anyone who wants to keep their thoughts, todos, and daily reflections in one place, accessible from any device.

- **Simplicity first:** Minimalist interface, just HTML + JS.
- **Eternal log:** Journal by day, jot down notes (“bits”), and revisit your journey anytime.
- **Cloud sync:** Link to your Google account to access your log across devices, or use it offline.
- **Pilot project:** This is an early version—usable as a journal and notetaking app, but expect some rough edges (UI fixes and more testing needed). It might evolve into something better (or not).
